# ATM
An exercise with MIT xPro, it's an ATM application that allows users to deposit and withdrawal money from their account.

# Installation
Download the folder, then naviagte to the root folder in your terminal. Once you're there, first run "npm install", then "npm start", and the program should begin.

# Future Improvements
I've added cosmetic improvements, but moving forward, I'd love to come back and add more improvements to the actual programming, such as allowing the user to withdrawal and deposit between multiple accounts, or providing some type of error message when they attempt to deposit too much.
